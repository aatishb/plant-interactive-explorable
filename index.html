              <span class="dropcap">I</span>magine you’re in a rainforest in Costa Rica, and you come across a great big trunk of a tree. You look down at the ground, and among the brown mix of roots and leaves you can clearly make out hundreds of little green lines, like arrow markers that surround the tree and point towards its base.

              This is the situation in which biologists Donald Strong and Thomas Ray found themselves in the 1970s. They describe seeing “thousands of bright green seedlings [..] in contrast against the brown leaf litter, creeping inward from all sides of the tree. The seedlings appear as short spokes of a wheel with the tree as the hub.”

            <p>
              The seedlings they saw were the young shoots of vines. But instead of meandering about and aimlessly exploring the forest floor around them, these young vines seem to ‘hone in’ on the trunk of the tree, a little like iron filings attracted to a magnet. Being the sort of folks who can’t walk away from a good question, these biologists wondered, how do these vines possibly ‘know’ which way to go? What was the force behind this mysterious ‘tree magnetism’?

              After conducting a bunch of experiments, they found that this vine, which they called Monstera gigantea (now known as Monstera tenuis) behaves in a way that, at first, seems totally paradoxical for a plant. It’s attracted to darkness. You read that right. A creature that relies on sunshine for its very existence spends its early life hunting for darkness.

              It starts as a teeny seedling, barely visible, poking up from the forest floor. Not much to look at. Not yet. But just knowing its name – Monstera gigantea – you know it’s about to get bigger.

              The seed starts to grow, peeps through the soil, and begins to elongate. It’s a slender, baby vine. Popping up on the forest floor, peeking out, stretching, growing. And so it starts to snake its way through the forest floor, bending left a little… right a little… left a little… right a little.
            </p>

              The thing about vines that makes them different from bushes and trees and sturdier plants, is they have no vertical architecture, nothing that holds them upright. Vines can’t shoot straight up toward the light like trees. Instead, they’re floppy. They would be the plant equivalent of snakes, stuck crawling on the ground. They move sideways, looking for something to grab onto, something to help them up.
